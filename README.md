# DS-Portfolio
My portfolio includes Data Science projects demonstrating expertise in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and data analysis. These projects cover end-to-end workflows, from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model development and evaluation, reflecting a strong foundation in data-driven decision-making and problem-solving.


## Projects

### 1. [Credit Card Fraud Detection System](https://github.com/ArchanaAnalytics/DS-Portfolio/blob/main/Projects/Credit%20Card%20Fraud%20Detection.ipynb)
- **Overview**: Developed a real-time fraud detection system using machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- **Key Techniques**:
  - Extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to analyze transaction patterns and detect anomalies.
  - SMOTE for handling class imbalance.
  - Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
- **Outcome**: Developed a model with promising potential for fraud detection. While the model effectively reduces false positives, improving recall and overall fraud detection accuracy may be limited by the inherent class imbalance in the dataset.

### 2. [Stock Price Forecasting with LSTM](https://github.com/ArchanaAnalytics/DS-Portfolio/blob/main/Projects/Stock%20Price%20Analysis%20and%20Forecasting.ipynb)
- **Overview**: Created a stock price prediction model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with historical market data.
- **Key Techniques**:
  - Time-series analysis to uncover trends and seasonality in stock prices.
  - Financial modeling and correlation analysis between major tech companies.
- **Outcome**: Developed a forecasting model that generates actionable insights for investment strategies and price volatility predictions.

### 3. [Image Captioning with Deep Learning](https://github.com/ArchanaAnalytics/DS-Portfolio/blob/main/Projects/Image%20Captioning%20System.ipynb)
- **Overview**: Built an image captioning model using VGG16 for feature extraction and LSTM for natural language generation.
- **Key Techniques**:
  - EDA on the Flickr8k dataset to analyze image-text relationships.
  - Tokenization, sequence padding, and vocabulary management for generating captions.
- **Outcome**: Developed a scalable image captioning system for generating accurate descriptions for unseen images.

### 4. [Movie Recommendation System](https://github.com/ArchanaAnalytics/DS-Portfolio/blob/main/Projects/Movie%20Recommendation%20System.ipynb)
- **Overview**: Built a recommendation system using demographic, content-based, and collaborative filtering techniques with TMDB's dataset.
- **Key Techniques**:
  - EDA to identify key features such as genre, cast, and user ratings.
  - Integrated weighted rating formulas and collaborative filtering for personalized recommendations.
- **Outcome**: Delivered a scalable solution for personalized movie recommendations for streaming platforms.

### 5. [Sentiment Analysis of E-Commerce Reviews](https://github.com/ArchanaAnalytics/DS-Portfolio/blob/main/Projects/Sentiment%20Analysis%20of%20E-Commerce%20Clothing%20Reviews.ipynb)
- **Overview**: Developed a sentiment analysis model using Naive Bayes algorithms (Bernoulli and Multinomial) to classify customer reviews from an e-commerce platform. Additionally, built models to predict customer feedback using various machine learning techniques, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Naive Bayes, and XGBoost.
- **Key Techniques**:
  - EDA to analyze review patterns, identify sentiment trends, and visualize feature distributions.
  - Performed data preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and skewness, while utilizing feature engineering to improve model accuracy.
  - Created word clouds to visualize frequent terms and enhance feature understanding.
- **Outcome**: Provided actionable insights for product recommendations and customer satisfaction improvements.
